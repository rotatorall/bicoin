        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Scott Melker, the host of “The Wolf Of All Streets” podcast, shared his bitcoin outlook with Kitco News last week. Melker is a trader and investor both privately and at Texas West Capital. He is the author of “The Wolf Den” newsletter and an advisor to a number of blockchain-based projects.

        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/dvision.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1280" data-image-height="720" data-href="https://nicepage.com">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The live debate will be conducted within the Dvision Metaverse on August 12, 2021, from 14:00 KST to 17:00 KST. The event is a landmark event initiated by the Korean Parliament in collaboration with the legislators from leading political parties such as the Democratic and People’s Power parties.

The issue of legislation of cryptocurrencies has emerged as a hot topic globally. Many in the financial sphere see improving existing KYC and AML compliance practices and tax filings as the way forward towards ensuring proper crypto regulations.

South Korea is regarded as an industry frontrunner in this aspect, and the debate will be addressing these core issues within the cryptocurrency industry. In addition, the debate is expected to attract experts, including the Korean National Assembly government officials, who will express their opinions on controversial issues within the cryptocurrency sphere.

The first speaker, Jeong Sangho, the CEO of Delio, a leading crypto finance company will be addressing the adoption of the custody and wallet business services from the legal perspective. The second speaker is a well-known lawyer Jo Wonhee (Chief Attorney at D’Light Law Firm), who will be discussing existing deficiencies in the Special Financial Information Law, that has been passed by the South Korean government in early March 2021 in order to initiate an early crypto regulation. The speaker is expected to emphasize the weak points in that key legislation and will address the improvements required to be made in the Special Financial Information Law.

        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/intel-santa-clara.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1200" data-image-height="675">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Intel has disclosed it owns Coinbase stock in a quarterly report submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) on Friday. The Santa Clara, California-based technology company bought the stake following the listing of the cryptocurrency exchange this spring.

According to the filed Form 13F, Intel had 3,014 shares of the platform’s operator, Coinbase Global Inc., as of June 30, valued at over $760,000 at the time. On that date, Coinbase’s stock closed at $253.30 per share, Market Watch details.

The price at the end of June was 22.8% lower than the $328.28 closing rate registered on the first day of trading of the COIN shares, April 14. The stocks have since recovered some of the lost value, recently exceeding $280.
