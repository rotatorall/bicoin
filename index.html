        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/wolf-all-streets.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1024" data-image-height="573">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Scott Melker, the host of “The Wolf Of All Streets” podcast, shared his bitcoin outlook with Kitco News last week. Melker is a trader and investor both privately and at Texas West Capital. He is the author of “The Wolf Den” newsletter and an advisor to a number of blockchain-based projects. In June last year, Binance awarded him the Influencer of the Year Award for North America.
         <br>
		He added that in the long run, bitcoin will likely be a seven-figure asset and ethereum a $20,000 to $30,000 asset at a minimum.

        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/1621257279_1280x720.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1280" data-image-height="720" data-href="https://nicepage.com">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The live debate will be conducted within the Dvision Metaverse on August 12, 2021, from 14:00 KST to 17:00 KST. The event is a landmark event initiated by the Korean Parliament in collaboration with the legislators from leading political parties such as the Democratic and People’s Power parties.

The issue of legislation of cryptocurrencies has emerged as a hot topic globally. Many in the financial sphere see improving existing KYC and AML compliance practices and tax filings as the way forward towards ensuring proper crypto regulations.

South Korea is regarded as an industry frontrunner in this aspect, and the debate will be addressing these core issues within the cryptocurrency industry. In addition, the debate is expected to attract experts, including the Korean National Assembly government officials, who will express their opinions on controversial issues within the cryptocurrency sphere.

The first speaker, Jeong Sangho, the CEO of Delio, a leading crypto finance company will be addressing the adoption of the custody and wallet business services from the legal perspective. The second speaker is a well-known lawyer Jo Wonhee (Chief Attorney at D’Light Law Firm), who will be discussing existing deficiencies in the Special Financial Information Law, that has been passed by the South Korean government in early March 2021 in order to initiate an early crypto regulation. The speaker is expected to emphasize the weak points in that key legislation and will address the improvements required to be made in the Special Financial Information Law.

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">For much of 2020, Asobo Studio had its head in the clouds. While airports around the globe came to a standstill, the French developer was putting the finishing touches on&nbsp;Microsoft Flight Simulator, offering a timely invitation to bright and beautiful getaways across the real-time airspace of planet earth. But after a brief stint in those digital skies, Asobo's focus is back deep amongst the grit and grime of terra firma, entrenched within the war-torn ravages of 12th century France.&nbsp;<br>One of the many new&nbsp;E3 2021 games&nbsp;revealed over the Summer,&nbsp;A Plague Tale: Requiem&nbsp;is the studio's next project, as the direct sequel to its 2019 action-adventure hit,&nbsp;A Plague Tale: Innocence. The brief cinematic teaser for the game didn't reveal much, but confirms that we'll be reunited with sibling protagonists Amicia and Hugo de Rune, with a launch slated for next year exclusively on next-generation consoles and PC (it'll also be available on Nintendo Switch via cloud streaming).&nbsp;With A Plague Tale: Innocence's next-gen update recently hitting&nbsp;Xbox Series X/S and&nbsp;PS5, in the Year of the Rat no less, now is thus the perfect time to catch up with Asobo's first original IP. Arriving in the same period as some of the best-action adventure games of our time, it was easy to let Innocence slip past you for better-known titles with bigger development budgets and marketing campaigns. But to keep it forever off your backlog would be to miss out on a quietly exceptional pilgrimage across a rarely explored slice of history, and the beginnings of what could well be one of the most promising new IPs of the last generation.
